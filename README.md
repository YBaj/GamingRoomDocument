Software Design Document and README for The Gaming Room project

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In this project I was working for The Gaming Room, a company that creates games. They were looking to expand their existing game, Draw it or Lose it onto multiple platforms. They wanted me to help expand it and fill out the design document. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this document I believe the area I did the best was my evaluations. This was my highlighting what the pros and cons were for each Operating System and how that could be affected by the parameters of the game. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think everything about this design document was helpful when working on the code. It was a great blueprint for understanding the client's needs and it helped me to highlight everything before I had begun on my work. Then once I began coding it was a great resource to come back to, as I had already broken down each category. So when deciding which operating system would be best, it was invaluable. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I could definitely stand to revise the Recommendations section. Choosing the Recommendation is what all of this kind of boiled down to, so when making that decision it needs to be very well thought-out. I think something like a diagram would be really helpful when tallying which Operating System would be the best for each category. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

As with any sort of project, the user's needs were very important here. The user needed the pictures of the puzzles to be instantaneous while involving multiple people and multiple teams, so something very responsive was necessary. Considering the user's needs when desigining is extremely important, because without it you do not have any need for the project. The user is ultimately who these things are for so if they do not like it then you have wasted your time. This is why considering the user's needs should be at the forefront of your mind.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Designing this software was approached in a very methodical way. First it was focused on the UML diagram, and then it was focused on the evaluation, and finally the recommendation. I would definitely like to keep a methodical and logical approach going forward, because it helps you keep things organized and ready.
